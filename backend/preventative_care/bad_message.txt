  "ai_summary": "# Cognitive Health Alert Report\n**Session 5 | February 14, 2026**\n\n---\n\n## 1. Overview\n\n**CRITICAL ALERT:** This session has identified a significant drop in cognitive performance markers, resulting in a high risk score of **82.7 out of 100**. The primary driver is a severe collapse in lexical diversity, suggesting substantial difficulty in word retrieval and a reliance on a very narrow set of repetitive vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Areas of Concern\n\n⚠️ **SEVERE CONCERN: Lexical Impoverishment** The most alarming finding is the Type-Token Ratio (TTR) of **0.18**, which is far below the healthy threshold of 0.40. This indicates that the speaker is repeating the same few words almost constantly, a common marker for advanced semantic processing difficulties.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Detailed Breakdown\n\n❌ **Extreme Vocabulary Loss** – A TTR of 0.18 means that for every 10 words spoken, only 1 or 2 are unique. This \"vocabulary desert\" suggests the brain is struggling to access its mental dictionary, leading to extreme repetition of basic phrases.\n\n✅ **Other Markers (Secondary)** – While speech flow and pronoun usage remain within normal ranges for now, the primary failure in vocabulary richness overshadows these secondary metrics.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Urgent Recommended Actions\n\nBecause this represents a significant deviation, we recommend the following:\n\n### **Medical Consultation**\n- **Contact a Neurologist or Primary Care Physician immediately.** Share this report and request a formal cognitive assessment (such as a MoCA or MMSE).\n- Review all current medications to rule out side effects or interactions causing sudden \"brain fog.\"\n\n### **Supportive Communication**\n- Use simple, direct language.\n- Avoid correcting their repetitive speech, as this can cause frustration. Instead, offer the words they seem to be searching for gently.\n\n---",
